Lambda the Ultimate
=========================


History
========
It is a recurring phrase used in a lot of papers. This was first used by Sussman and Steele in the 70s, 
who demonstrated the use of lambda calculus in their papers. They also devised scheme, a dialect of lisp
we use in this course to learn more about functional programming.

What is "Lambda the Ultimate"?
===============================
This is a slogan which signifies the fact that lambdas can be used to implement everything in other
 languages. The lambda is universal and lambda based expressions are efficient to use and seem more natural.


Some of the instances of its use
==================================
As a result, this catchy phrase or slogan is used by many blogs, papers, books and even courses that deal 
with programming languages. One of the links claims lambda as the ultimate worksheet function and talks
 about the introduction of lambda in Microsoft Excel.

Lambda-the ultimate imperative is the name of a report by MIT describing how to model the
 different programming in terms of lambda expressions. A popular blog which posts about various developments
going on in programming languages also uses this slogan as its name. One of the papers describes lambda as
 the ultimate label which can be used for optimizing compilers in scheme.
